# Motion Ticker
Motion Ticker is a HTML5 javascript-application for analysing the motion of objects in videos. It is primarily intended for use in the classroom to educate people about motion and mechanics. The name is a tribute to the old-fashioned ticker taper timers that were used in the era before computers and smartphones were widespread.
